The data are provided by the [Open Trade Statistics project]https://tradestatistics.io/ using an API (application programmer interface). 
This allows computer programs to access the data selectively.

textiles <- c("57", "58", "59", "60", "61", "62", "63")

if(fullrun){
  df <- ots_create_tidy_data(years = c(1962:2018), 
                              reporters = "all", 
                              partners = "all",
                              products = clothing, 
                              table = "yrpc") # Product trade at detailed level (Year, reporter, and Product Code)
  saveRDS(df, file = "clothing_exports.rds")
} else { df <- readRDS(file = "clothing_exports.rds")
  
}

# Viz By product group

```{r}
agg_df <- df %>% group_by(year, section_code, group_code, product_shortname_english) %>% 
  summarise(tot_exp = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = TRUE)/1e9)

ggplot(agg_df, aes(x = year, y = tot_exp, 
                   col = product_shortname_english, group = product_shortname_english)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ group_code, ncol = 1)
```


# By country

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_industry#Production):

>In 2016, the largest apparel exporting nations were China ($161 billion), Bangladesh ($28 billion), Vietnam ($25 billion), India ($18 billion), Hong Kong ($16 billion), Turkey ($15 >billion) and Indonesia ($7 billion). 

Let us verify this statement.

```{r}
agg_df <- df %>% filter(group_code %in% c("61", "62")) %>%
  group_by(year, reporter_iso, reporter_fullname_english) %>% 
  summarise(tot_exp = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = TRUE)/1e9)

top <- df %>% filter(year == 2016) %>% group_by(reporter_fullname_english) %>%
  summarise(tot_exp = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = TRUE)/1e9) %>% 
  top_n(n = 12)

top_countries <- top$reporter_fullname_english

ggplot(subset(agg_df, reporter_fullname_english %in% top_countries), aes(x = year, y = tot_exp)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~reporter_fullname_english, scales = "free_y")

```

We can see that Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Turkey are large clothing exporters as well.
Turns out that European countries are missing from this statement.

Checking the original source, we find that the EU was mentioned, but not the individual countries.

An additional check is this source from India (with a broader definition of Textiles):

# Prepare aggregated set for the course

```{r}
df2 <- df %>% group_by(year, reporter_iso, reporter_fullname_english, partner_iso, partner_fullname_english) %>%
  summarise(export_value_usd = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = TRUE)/1e9, import_value_usd = sum(import_value_usd, na.rm = TRUE)/1e9)

saveRDS(df2, "clothing_exports_aggregated.rds")
```
